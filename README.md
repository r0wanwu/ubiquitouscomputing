This repository contains code, writeups, and resources for ubiquitous computing assignments.

## 1. Litter Box Telltale
A small, self-contained device designed to track a cat’s litter box activity. Mounted inside or near a covered litter box, the device uses sensors to detect motion, log bathroom sessions, and display usage information, providing real-time feedback about the litter box’s status and reminding owners when it’s time to clean.

Materials:
- Adafruit Clue board
- USB Type C to Micro B cable
- LiPo battery
- LiPo charging board
